# Building the Ingress Controller Image

This document explains how to build an Ingress Controller image. Note that for NGINX, we provide the image though [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nginx/nginx-ingress/). For NGINX Plus, you need to build the image.

## Prerequisites

Before you can build the image, make sure that the following software is installed on your machine:
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) v18.09+
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/), optionally, if you would like to generate a self-signed certificate and a key for the default server.
* For NGINX Plus, you must have the NGINX Plus license -- the certificate (`nginx-repo.crt`) and the key (`nginx-repo.key`).

Although the Ingress controller is written in golang, golang is not required, as the Ingress controller binary will be built in a Docker container.

## Building the Image and Pushing It to the Private Registry

We build the image using the make utility and the provided `Makefile`. Let’s create the controller binary, build an image and push the image to the private registry.

1. Make sure to run the `docker login` command first to login to the registry. If you’re using Google Container Registry, you don’t need to use the docker command to login -- make sure you’re logged into the gcloud tool (using the `gcloud auth login` command) and set the variable `PUSH_TO_GCR=1` when running the make command.

1. Clone the Ingress controller repo:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/
    ```

1. Build the image:
    * For NGINX:
      ```
      $ make PREFIX=myregistry.example.com/nginx-ingress
      ```
      `myregistry.example.com/nginx-ingress` defines the repo in your private registry where the image will be pushed. Substitute that value with the repo in your private registry.

      As a result, the image **myregistry.example.com/nginx-ingress:edge** is built and pushed to the registry. Note that the tag `edge` comes from the `VERSION` variable, defined in the Makefile.

    * For NGINX Plus, first, make sure that the certificate (`nginx-repo.crt`) and the key (`nginx-repo.key`) of your license are located in the root of the project:
      ```
      $ ls nginx-repo.*
      nginx-repo.crt  nginx-repo.key
      ```
      Then run:
      ```
      $ make DOCKERFILE=DockerfileForPlus PREFIX=myregistry.example.com/nginx-plus-ingress
      ```
      `myregistry.example.com/nginx-plus-ingress` defines the repo in your private registry where the image will be pushed. Substitute that value with the repo in your private registry.

      As a result, the image **myregistry.example.com/nginx-plus-ingress:edge** is built and pushed to the registry. Note that the tag `edge` comes from the `VERSION` variable, defined in the Makefile.

Next you will find the details about available Makefile targets and variables.

### Makefile Targets

The **Makefile** we provide has the following targets:
* **test**: runs unit tests (ignored when `BUILD_IN_CONTAINER` is `1`).
* **binary**: creates the controller binary using local golang environment (ignored when `BUILD_IN_CONTAINER` is `1`).
* **container**: builds a Docker image.
* **push**: pushes the image to the private Docker registry.
* **all** (the default target): executes the four targets above in the order listed. If one of the targets fails, the execution process stops, reporting an error.

### Makefile Variables

The **Makefile** contains the following main variables for you to customize (either by changing the Makefile or by overriding the variables in the make command):
* **PREFIX** -- the name of the image. The default is `nginx/nginx-ingress`.
* **VERSION** -- the current version of the controller.
* **TAG** -- the tag added to the image. It's set to the value of the `VERSION` variable by default.
* **PUSH_TO_GCR**. If you’re running your Kubernetes in GCE and using Google Container Registry, make sure that `PUSH_TO_GCR = 1`. This means using the `gcloud docker push` command to push the image, which is convenient when pushing images to GCR. By default, the variable is unset and the regular `docker push` command is used to push the image to the registry.
* **DOCKERFILEPATH** -- the path to the Dockerfiles folder. The default is `build`.
* **DOCKERFILE** -- the path to a Dockerfile. We provide nine Dockerfiles:
  1. `Dockerfile`, for building a debian-based image with NGINX. It's used by default.
  1. `DockerfileForAlpine`, for building an alpine-based image with NGINX.
  1. `DockerfileForPlus`, for building an debian-based image with NGINX Plus.
  1. `DockerfileWithOpentracing`, for building a debian-based image with NGINX, [opentracing](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/nginx-opentracing) module and the [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) tracer.
  1. `DockerfileWithOpentracingForPlus`, for building a debian-based image with NGINX Plus, [opentracing](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/nginx-opentracing) module and the [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) tracer.
  1. `openshift/Dockerfile`, for building an ubi-based image with NGINX for [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/) clusters.
  1. `openshift/DockerfileForPlus`, for building an ubi-based image with NGINX Plus for [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/) clusters.
  1. `appprotect/DockerfileWithAppProtectForPlusForOpenShift`, for building an ubi-based image with NGINX Plus and the [appprotect](/nginx-app-protect/) module for [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/) clusters.
      Note: You need to place a file named `rhel_license` containing Your Organization and Activation key in the project root. Example: 
      ```bash 
      RHEL_ORGANIZATION=1111111
      RHEL_ACTIVATION_KEY=your-key
      ```
  1. `appprotect/DockerfileWithAppProtectForPlus`, for building a debian-based image with NGINX Plus and the [appprotect](/nginx-app-protect/) module.
* **GENERATE_DEFAULT_CERT_AND_KEY** - The Ingress controller requires a certificate and a key for the default HTTP/HTTPS server. You can reference them in a TLS Secret in a command-line argument to the Ingress controller. As an alternative, you can add a file in the PEM format with your certificate and key to the image as `/etc/nginx/secrets/default`. Optionally, you can generate a self-signed certificate and a key during the build process. Set `GENERATE_DEFAULT_CERT_AND_KEY` to `1` to generate a certificate and a key in the `default.pem` file. Note that you must add the `ADD` instruction in the Dockerfile to copy the cert and the key to the image. The default value of `GENERATE_DEFAULT_CERT_AND_KEY` is `0`.
* **DOCKER_BUILD_OPTIONS** -- the [options](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#options) for the `docker build` command. For example, `--pull`.
* **BUILD_IN_CONTAINER** -- By default, to compile the controller we use the [golang](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/) container that we run as part of the building process. If you want to compile the controller using your local golang environment:
  1. Make sure that the Ingress controller repo is in your `$GOPATH`.
  1. Specify `BUILD_IN_CONTAINER=0` when you run the make command.
