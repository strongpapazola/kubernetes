CHANGES:
* [1182](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1182) Update NGINX version to 1.19.3.

UPGRADE:
* For NGINX, use the 1.9.0 image from our DockerHub: `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.9.0`, `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.9.0-alpine` or `nginx-ingress:1.9.0-ubi`
* For NGINX Plus, please build your own image using the 1.9.0 source code.
* For Helm, use version 0.7.0 of the chart.

For Kubernetes >= 1.18, when upgrading using the [manifests](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-manifests/), make sure to update the [ClusterRole](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/blob/v1.9.0/deployments/rbac/rbac.yaml) and create the [IngressClass resource](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/blob/v1.9.0/deployments/common/ingress-class.yaml), which is required for Kubernetes >= 1.18. Otherwise, the Ingress Controller will fail to start. If you run multiple NGINX Ingress Controllers in the cluster, each Ingress Controller must have its own IngressClass resource. As the `-use-ingress-class-only` argument is now ignored (see NOTES), make sure your Ingress resources have the `ingressClassName` field or the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation set to the name of the IngressClass resource. Otherwise, the Ingress Controller will ignore them.

HELM UPGRADE:
* If you're using custom resources like VirtualServer and TransportServer (`controller.enableCustomResources` is set to `true`), after you run the `helm upgrade` command, the CRDs will not be upgraded. After running the `helm upgrade` command, run `kubectl apply -f deployments/helm-chart/crds` to upgrade the CRDs.
* For Kubernetes >= 1.18, a dedicated IngressClass resource, which is configured by `controller.ingressClass`, is required per helm release. Ensure `controller.ingressClass` is not set to the name of the IngressClass of other releases or Ingress Controllers. As the `controller.useIngressClassOnly` parameter is now ignored (see NOTES), make sure your Ingress resources have the `ingressClassName` field or the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation set to the value of `controller.ingressClass`. Otherwise, the Ingress Controller will ignore them.

NOTES:
* When using Kubernetes >= 1.18, the `-use-ingress-class-only` command-line argument is now ignored, and the Ingress Controller will only process resources that belong to its class. See [IngressClass doc](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/running-multiple-ingress-controllers/#ingress-class) for more details.
* For Kubernetes >= 1.18, a dedicated IngressClass resource, which is configured by `controller.ingressClass`, is required per helm release. When upgrading or installing releases, ensure `controller.ingressClass` is not set to the name of the IngressClass of other releases or Ingress Controllers.

* For NGINX Plus, please build your own image using the 1.8.1 source code.
* For Helm, use version 0.6.1 of the chart.

* Introducing a new configuration resource - Policy - with the first policy for IP-based access control. 

You will find the complete changelog for release 1.8.0, including bug fixes, improvements, and changes below.

FEATURES FOR VIRTUALSERVER AND VIRTUALSERVERROUTE RESOURCES:
* [1036](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1036): Add VirtualServer custom template support.
* [1028](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1028): Add access control policy.

FEATURES:
* [1035](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1035): Support for App Protect module.
* [1029](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1029): Add readiness endpoint.

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Documentation improvements: [946](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/946) thanks to [è°­ä¹é¼](https://github.com/imba-tjd), [948](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/948), [972](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/972), [965](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/965).

BUGFIXES:
* [1030](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1030): Fix port range validation in cli arguments.
* [953](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/953): Fix error logging of master/minion ingresses.

HELM CHART:
* The version of the helm chart is now 0.6.0.
* Add new parameters to the Chart: `controller.appprotect.enable`, `controller.globalConfiguration.create`, `controller.globalConfiguration.spec`, `controller.readyStatus.enable`, `controller.readyStatus.port`, `controller.config.annotations`, `controller.reportIngressStatus.annotations`. Added in  [1035](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1035), [1034](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1034), [1029](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1029), [1003](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1003) thanks to [RubyLangdon](https://github.com/RubyLangdon). 
* [1047](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1047) and [1009](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1009): Change how Helm manages the custom resource defintions (CRDs) to support installing multiple Ingress Controller releases. **Note**: If you're using the custom resources (`controller.enableCustomResources` is set to `true`), this is a breaking change. See the HELM UPGRADE section below for the upgrade instructions.

CHANGES:
* Update NGINX version to 1.19.1.
* Update NGINX Plus to R22.
* [1029](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1029): Add readiness endpoint. The Ingress Controller now exposes a readiness endpoint on port `8081` and the path `/nginx-ready`. The endpoint returns a `200` response after the Ingress Controller finishes the initial configuration of NGINX at the start. The pod template was updated to use that endpoint in a readiness probe. 
* [980](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/980): Enable leader election by default.

UPGRADE:
* For NGINX, use the 1.8.0 image from our DockerHub: `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.8.0`, `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.8.0-alpine` or `nginx-ingress:1.8.0-ubi`
* For NGINX Plus, please build your own image using the 1.8.0 source code.
* For Helm, use version 0.6.0 of the chart.

HELM UPGRADE:

If you're using custom resources like VirtualServer and TransportServer (`controller.enableCustomResources` is set to `true`), after you run the `helm upgrade` command, the CRDs and the corresponding custom resources will be removed from the cluster. Before upgrading, make sure to back up the custom resources. After running the `helm upgrade` command, run `kubectl apply -f deployments/helm-chart/crds` to re-install the CRDs and then restore the custom resources.

NOTES:
* As part of installing a release, Helm will install the CRDs unless that step is disabled (see the [corresponding doc](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-helm/)). The installed CRDs include the CRDs for all Ingress Controller features, including the ones disabled by default (like App Protect with `aplogconfs.appprotect.f5.com` and `appolicies.appprotect.f5.com` CRDs).

UPGRADE:
* For NGINX, use the 1.6.0 image from our DockerHub: `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.6.0` or `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.6.0-alpine`
* For NGINX Plus, please build your own image using the 1.6.0 source code.
* For Helm, use version 0.4.0 of the chart.

HELM UPGRADE:

If leader election (the `controller.reportIngressStatus.enableLeaderElection` parameter) is enabled, when upgrading to the new version of the Helm chart:
1. Make sure to specify a new ConfigMap lock name (`controller.reportIngressStatus.leaderElectionLockName`) different from the one that was created by the current version. To find out the current name, check ConfigMap resources in the namespace where the Ingress Controller is running.
1. After the upgrade, delete the old ConfigMap.

Otherwise, the helm upgrade will not succeed.
